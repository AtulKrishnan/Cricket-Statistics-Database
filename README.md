# Cricket-Statistics-Database
A C program that creates records for different players and stores them in a database as a CSV file.

The Cricket Statistics Database was done by a team of us as a project for our college.
We have used a simple array data structure here to store the records.
It can also be implemented using linked lists which might be more space efficient.
All the records saved are also stored in a database which is csv file that we have created so that no data is lost when we exit the program.
There are options to add, delete, modify, search and display all records.

All the files have been included in the folder that i have committed to this repository.
A .exe working application has also been uploaded to see how the code works. Also present is a make file.
So instead of compiling all files seperately you could run the make file.
